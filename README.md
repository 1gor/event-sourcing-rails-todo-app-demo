# Event Sourcing on Rails - Demo app

We've put together a minimal Event Sourcing framework to power
https://d.rip and we [wrote about it](https://kickstarter.engineering/event-sourcing-made-simple-4a2625113224) on the [kickstarter engineering blog](https://kickstarter.engineering/event-sourcing-made-simple-4a2625113224).

This is a working demo application. The ~300 lines of code
making the Event Sourcing framework are under
[`app/models/lib`](https://github.com/pcreux/event-sourcing-rails-todo-app-demo/tree/master/app/models/lib).

This code is for educational purpose.
